# Emergence of Urban Growth Patterns from Human Movements

## Empirical City Data

We use three empirical datasets collected from cities in USA, GB and Berlin region. The USA and GB datasets are originally released by US Census Bureau (https://www.census.gov/) and Statistical Office of the European Union (https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/eurostat-european-statistics_en), respectively. We use the preprocessed datasets extracted from USA 2000 Census and GB 1991 Cenus, which are available available in (https://hmakse.ccny.cuny.edu/software-and-data/). The Berlin data is extracted from the settlement area distributions in Berlin region in 1910, 1920 and 1945, which are originally acquired from Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boroughs_and_localities_of_Berlin) and available in the Berlin folder.

## Collective Mobility Model
